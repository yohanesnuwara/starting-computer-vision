## Absolute beginner course on computer vision with Python, OpenCV, Tensorflow Keras, and PyTorch

I'm hosting some of my lectures on introductory computer vision here in GitHub so that others can follow and learn too. Computer vision is not a hard subject if we know the essentials. These lessons train the essentials from the ground up. 

### Contents:

* Image Processing and Segmentation with NumPy, Matplotlib, and OpenCV ðŸ‘‰ [Notebook](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/starting-computer-vision/blob/main/Lesson_01_Basic_Image_Processing.ipynb)
* Image Classification with Keras: Dense Neural Network (DNN) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) ðŸ‘‰ [Notebook](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/starting-computer-vision/blob/main/Lesson_02_Neural_Networks_with_Tensorflow.ipynb)
* Transfer Learning for Image Classification with Keras CNN ðŸ‘‰ [Notebook](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/starting-computer-vision/blob/main/Lesson_03_Image_Classification.ipynb)
* Object Detection with PyTorch and YOLOv5 ðŸ‘‰ [Notebook](https://github.com/yohanesnuwara/starting-computer-vision/blob/main/Lesson_05_Object_Detection.ipynb)
